This project was made for "coding_challenge-30 --- PongPongPong (using JavaScript or Python)" of ZTM.
Using Ricardo Milos materials is only for entertainment purpose with all due respect and as the identity of Ricardo is a well-beloved character on the Internet,
one of my personal favorites too.

Hope everyone enjoys this mini game I created.
Make it throught to 7 points to beat this game.
Have fun!
